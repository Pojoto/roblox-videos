# roblox-videos


These are a collection of some of the Roblox videos found on my [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@pojoto1936). 


Each folder contains a different project, and you can download and open the `.rblx` files to play the project yourself. The raw source code is also available to view in the `src` directories in each project folder.

**Feel free to use/edit my places however you want!**



Note: The files all work as shown in the videos, but I haven't cleaned up any code or parts so the places may be very messy.
